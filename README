Every end of a chapter has a new beginning to face. When we reach a new chapter of our life we usually have new roles, routines, relationship and assumptions to adjust with. The new roles that i encounter right know is to be more responsible in all the things and actions that i will do. To be prepared to face more hard and challenging problems and work. To face the real world of being adolescence and to be updated about the social issues that is happening in our country. The new routines that i have to adjust with is i need to wake up early and commute everyday going to De La Salle College of Saint Benilde as well as going home. I also have to adjust about eating lunch time, especially everyday we have different subjects and time of schedule. I also have to adjust about the system of having many homeworks and research paper to do. Every chapter we encounter new relationships like meeting new set of friends with different attitudes. Meeting people with our opposite sex, and having deeper relationship with them. So its also hard to adjust with the new friend you are with, especially when your friends on a certain subject is different from the other subject. I have many assumptions this college. To develop self-confidence to myself and to the public. I learn about the things that I don't know yet especially about my course BS-IT. To design my own game design.
